abstract = "Building robust low and mid-level image representations, beyond edge primitives, is a long-standing goal in vision. Many existing feature detectors spatially pool edge information which destroys cues such as edge intersections, parallelism and symmetry. We present a learning framework where features that capture these mid-level cues spontaneously emerge from image data. Our approach is based on the convolutional decomposition of images under a sparsity constraint and is totally unsupervised. By building a hierarchy of such decompositions we can learn rich feature sets that are a robust image representation for both the analysis and synthesis of images.",

@misc{DRN,
  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual
learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially
deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as
learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of
learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence
showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain
accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate
residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but
still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves
3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the
ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100
and 1000 layers.
  The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual
recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain
a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual
nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions,
where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet
localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

@article{Bi-RNN,
  abstract = {In the first part of this paper, a regular recurrent neural network (RNN) is extended to a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN). The BRNN can be trained without the limitation of using input information just up to a preset future frame. This is accomplished by training it simultaneously in positive and negative time direction. Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the TIMIT database show the same tendency. In the second part of this paper, it is shown how the proposed bidirectional structure can be easily modified to allow efficient estimation of the conditional posterior probability of complete symbol sequences without making any explicit assumption about the shape of the distribution. For this part, experiments on real data are reported},

We find that the growth in polarization in recent years is largest for the demographic groups least likely to use the internet and social media. For example, our overall index and eight of the nine individual measures show greater increases for those older than 75 than for those aged 18–39. These facts argue against the hypothesis that the internet is a primary driver of rising political polarization.},

abstract="Plagiarism is considered to be a highly unethical activity in the academic world. Text-alignment is currently the preferred technique for estimating the degree of similarity with existing written works. Due to its dependency on other documents it becomes increasingly tedious and time-consuming to scale up to the growing number of online and offline documents. Thus, this paper aims at studying the use of stylometric features present in a document in order to verify its authorship. Two machine learning algorithms, namely k-NN and SMO, were used to predict the authenticity of the writings. A computer program consisting of 446 features was implemented. Ten PhD theses, split into different segments of 1000, 5000 and 10000 words, were used, totaling 520 documents as our corpus. Our results show that authorship attribution using stylometry method has generated an accuracy of above 90 {\%}, except for 7-NN with 1000 words. We also showed how authorship attribution can be used to identify potential cases of plagiarism in formal writings.",
